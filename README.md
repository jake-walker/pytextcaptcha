# TextCaptcha

> A Python library for using text-based CAPTCHAs from <http://textcaptcha.com/>.

This is a simple wrapper around the [TextCaptcha](http://textcaptcha.com/) API which is a service which provides text-based CAPTCHA questions which helps to prevent spam from robots.

This is designed to be implemented into a server-side application such as a Discord Bot, IRC, SMS, etc...

**Note:** *The TextCaptcha API is only suitable for low traffic websites. For more than 5 requests per second, your usage will be rate limited.*

## Installation

Use `pip` to install on all systems:

```bash
pip install textcaptcha
```

## Usage Example

This example will ask a CAPTCHA question and ask for an answer which is then checked against the actual answer.

```python
import textcaptcha

# Create a captcha fetcher to fetch captcha questions from the API
fetcher = textcaptcha.CaptchaFetcher()
# Fetch a new captcha from the API
captcha = fetcher.fetch()

# Print the captcha question to the console
print(captcha.question)
# Get a response from the user
answer = input("Answer: ")

# Check that the answer is correct
if captcha.check_answer(answer):
    print("You're not a robot!")
else:
    print("You are a robot, sorry!")
```
